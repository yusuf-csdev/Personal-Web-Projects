        <h1>The Nature</h1>
        <p>
          The word nature is derived from the Latin word natura, or "essential
          qualities, innate disposition", and in ancient times, literally meant
          "birth". In ancient philosophy, natura is mostly used as the Latin
          translation of the Greek word physis (φύσις), which originally related
          to the intrinsic characteristics that plants, animals, and other
          features of the world develop of their own accord. The concept of
          nature as a whole, the physical universe, is one of several expansions
          of the original notion; it began with certain core applications of the
          word φύσις by pre-Socratic philosophers (though this word had a
          dynamic dimension then, especially for Heraclitus), and has steadily
          gained currency ever since.

          Animals (also called Metazoa) are multicellular eukaryotic organisms
          that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions,
          animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move,
          can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the
          blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal
          species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but
          it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in
          total. Animals range in length from 8.5 micrometres (0.00033 in) to
          33.6 metres (110 ft). They have complex interactions with each other
          and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The kingdom
          Animalia includes humans but in colloquial use the term animal often
          refers only to non-human animals. The scientific study of animals is
          known as zoology.

        <h2 id="landscape">Landscapes</h2>
        <p>
          A landscape is the visible features of an area of land, its landforms,
          and how they integrate with natural or man-made features.[1] A
          landscape includes the physical elements of geophysically defined
          landforms such as (ice-capped) mountains, hills, water bodies such as
          rivers, lakes, ponds and the sea, living elements of land cover
          including indigenous vegetation, human elements including different
          forms of land use, buildings, and structures, and transitory elements
          such as lighting and weather conditions. Combining both their physical
          origins and the cultural overlay of human presence, often created over
          millennia, landscapes reflect a living synthesis of people and place
          that is vital to local and national identity.
