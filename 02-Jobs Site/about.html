                Steve Jobs co-founded Apple Computers with Steve Wozniak. Under
                Jobs' guidance, the company pioneered a series of revolutionary
                technologies, including the iPhone and iPad.

            <h2>Who Was Steve Jobs?</h2>
            <p>
              Steven Paul Jobs was an American inventor, designer and
              entrepreneur who was the co-founder, chief executive and chairman
              of Apple Computer. Apple's revolutionary products, which include
              the iPod, iPhone and iPad, are now seen as dictating the evolution
              of modern technology. Born in 1955 to two University of Wisconsin
              graduate students who gave him up for adoption, Jobs was smart but
              directionless, dropping out of college and experimenting with
              different pursuits before co-founding Apple with Steve Wozniak in
              1976. Jobs left the company in 1985, launching Pixar Animation
              Studios, then returned to Apple more than a decade later. Jobs
              died in 2011 following a long battle with pancreatic cancer.

            <h2>Steve Jobs’ Parents and Adoption</h2>
            <p>
              Jobs was born to Joanne Schieble (later Joanne Simpson) and
              Abdulfattah "John" Jandali, two University of Wisconsin graduate
              students. The couple gave up their unnamed son for adoption. Jobs’
              father, Jandali, was a Syrian political science professor. His
              mother, Schieble, worked as a speech therapist. Shortly after Jobs
              was placed for adoption, his biological parents married and had
              another child, Mona Simpson. It was not until Jobs was 27 that he
              was able to uncover information on his biological parents. As an
              infant, Jobs was adopted by Clara and Paul Jobs and named Steven
              Paul Jobs. Clara worked as an accountant and Paul was a Coast
              Guard veteran and machinist.

            <h2>Early Life</h2>
            <p>
              Jobs was born on February 24, 1955, in San Francisco, California.
              He lived with his adoptive family in Mountain View, California,
              within the area that would later become known as Silicon Valley.
              As a boy, Jobs and his father worked on electronics in the family
              garage. Paul showed his son how to take apart and reconstruct
              electronics, a hobby that instilled confidence, tenacity and
              mechanical prowess in young Jobs.

            <h2>Steve Jobs’ Education and College</h2>
            <p>
              While Jobs was always an intelligent and innovative thinker, his
              youth was riddled with frustrations over formal schooling. Jobs
              was a prankster in elementary school due to boredom, and his
              fourth-grade teacher needed to bribe him to study. Jobs tested so
              well, however, that administrators wanted to skip him ahead to
              high school — a proposal that his parents declined. After high
              school, Jobs enrolled at Reed College in Portland, Oregon. Lacking
              direction, he dropped out of college after six months and spent
              the next 18 months dropping in on creative classes at the school.
              Jobs later recounted how one course in calligraphy developed his
              love of typography. In 1974, Jobs took a position as a video game
              designer with Atari. Several months later he left the company to
              find spiritual enlightenment in India, traveling further and
              experimenting with psychedelic drugs.

            <h2>Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs</h2>
            <p>
              Back when Jobs was enrolled at Homestead High School, he was
              introduced to his future partner and co-founder of Apple Computer,
              Wozniak, who was attending the University of California, Berkeley.
              In a 2007 interview with PC World, Wozniak spoke about why he and
              Jobs clicked so well: "We both loved electronics and the way we
              used to hook up digital chips," Wozniak said. "Very few people,
              especially back then, had any idea what chips were, how they
              worked and what they could do. I had designed many computers, so I
              was way ahead of him in electronics and computer design, but we
              still had common interests. We both had pretty much sort of an
              independent attitude about things in the world.”
